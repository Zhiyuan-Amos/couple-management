# Not use Domain-Driven Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Implementing DDD well seems to be complicated. One example is [enforcing no duplicates](https://github.com/ardalis/DDD-NoDuplicates), which has 11 different solutions, and even the best solutions require quite a bit of work (see points 10 & 11, which require using MediatR).

## Decision

Stick with existing implementation.
